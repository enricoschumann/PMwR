  The function is meant for pretty-printing of US
  treasury bond quotes; it provides no other
  functionality.

  If \code{price} is \code{numeric}, it is interpreted as a quote in
  decimal notation and \sQuote{translated} into a price quoted in
  fractions of a point.

  If \code{price} is \code{character}, it is interpreted as a quote in
  fractional notation.

  \code{q32} is a short-hand for \code{quote32}.

}
