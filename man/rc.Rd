  Return Contribution
}
\description{
  Return contribution of portfolio segments.
}
\usage{
rc(R, weights, timestamp, segments = NULL,
   R.bm = NULL, weights.bm = NULL,
   method = "contribution",
   linking.method = NULL,
   allocation.minus.bm = TRUE,
   tol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps))
}
\arguments{
  \item{R}{%
    returns: a numeric matrix. Rows are time periods;
    columns are assets.
  }
  \item{weights}{%
    the segment weights: a numeric matrix.
    \code{weights[i, j]} must correspond to \code{R[i, j]}
  }
  \item{timestamp}{%
    character or numeric
  }
  \item{segments}{%
    character. If missing, column names of \code{R} or of
    \code{weights} are used (if they are not \code{NULL}).
  }

  \item{method}{%
    a string; default is \code{contribution}, and also
    supported are \code{attribution}, \code{bottomup} or
    \code{topdown}
  }

  \item{linking.method}{%

    \code{NULL} or a string. Currently supported are
    \code{0-cumulative, 1-cumulative, 0.5-cumulative}
    (\code{geometric{0,1,0.5}}) and \code{logarithmic}. See
    Examples.

  }

  \item{allocation.minus.bm}{logical}

  \item{tol}{%
    numeric: weights whose absolute value is below
    \code{tol} are considered zero and not used for
    computations. Ignored if \code{\link{NA}}.
  }

  If portfolio returns are to be compared against benchmark
  returns, benchmark returns and weights must be supplied:

  \item{R.bm}{%
    benchmark returns: a numeric matrix
  }
  \item{weights.bm}{%
    the benchmark weights of segments: a numeric matrix.
    \code{weights.bm[i, j]} must correspond to \code{R.bm[i, j]}
  }
}
\details{%

  The function computes segment contribution, potentially
  over time.  Returns and weights must be arranged in
  matrices, with rows corresponding to time periods and
  columns to portfolio segments.  If \code{weights} and
  \code{R} are atomic vectors, then they are interpreted as
  cross-sectional weights/returns for a single period,
  i.e. they are handled like row vectors.

  Weights can be missing, in which case \code{R} is assumed
  to already comprise segment returns.

  Note that the segment contributions need not come from
  asset classes; the computation works for any additive
  single-period decomposition of portfolio returns.

}
\value{%

  For method \code{contribution}, a list of two components:
  \item{period_contributions}{a data.frame of single-period
   contributions, sorted in time}
 \item{total_contributions}{a numeric vector}

## ==> contributions grow at portfolio rate-of-return
rc(R, weights, linking.method =  "geometric1")

## ==> contributions are made on top of current portfolio-value
rc(R, weights, linking.method =  "geometric0")

## ==> mixture
rc(R, weights, linking.method =  "geometric0.5")
